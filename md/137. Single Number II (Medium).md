## 137. Single Number II (Medium)

链接： <https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/description/>

## 题目解读： 

136题的升级版，这次绝大部分数是出现三次，只有一个数出现一次。

## 解题思路： 

**思路1:**

* 跟136一样，先排序，然后遍历

**思路2:**

* 跟136一样，先剔除，然后求和相减

**思路3:**

* 这次异或做不起来了，异或出来应该是所有的数，但是应该有其他解决办法

## 代码： 

```python
class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        # Solution1
        # nums.sort()
        # if(len(nums)==1):
        #     return nums[0]
        # i = 0
        # while i < len(nums)-1:
        #     if(nums[i]!=nums[i+1] or nums[i]!=nums[i+2] or nums[i+1]!=nums[i+2]):
        #         return nums [i]^nums[i+1]^nums[i+2]
        #     i += 3
        # return nums[-1]

        # Solution 2
        # nums_pure = set(nums)
        # return (sum(nums_pure)*3 - sum(nums))/2

        # Solution 3
        x1 = 0
        x2 = 0
        for num in nums:
            x2 = x2 ^ (x1 & num)
            x1 = x1 ^ num
            mask = ~(x1&x2)
            x2 &= mask
            x1 &= mask

        return x1
```



## 新的收获： 

- 这个解释很全面可以看一下：<https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/discuss/43295/Detailed-explanation-and-generalization-of-the-bitwise-operation-method-for-single-numbers> 

  > At the beginning, all bits of the counter is initialized to zero, i.e., xm = 0, ..., x1 = 0. Since we are gonna choose bitwise operations that guarantee all bits of the counter remain unchanged if we hit 0's, the counter will be 0 until we hit the first 1 in the array. After we hit the first 1, we got:  xm = 0, ...,x2 = 0, x1 = 1. Let's continue until we hit the second 1, after which we have:  xm = 0, ..., x2 = 1, x1 = 0. Note that x1 changed from 1 to 0. For x1 = x1 | i, after the second count, x1 will still be 1. So it's clear we should use x1 = x1 ^ i. What about x2, ..., xm? The idea is to find the condition under which x2, ..., xm will change their values. Take x2 as an example. If we hit a 1 and need to change the value of x2, what must be the value of x1 right before we do the change? The answer is: x1 must be 1 otherwise we shouldn't change x2 because changing x1 from 0 to 1 will do the job. So x2 will change value only if x1and i are both 1, or mathematically, x2 = x2 ^ (x1 & i). Similarly xm will change value only when xm-1, ..., x1 and i are all 1: xm = xm ^ (xm-1 & ... & x1 & i). Bingo, we've found the bitwise operations!

- 就感觉相当于代码中的x1，x2，x3为不同位上的计数器
